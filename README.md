My project for the Bitnob Hackathon

BUILDIING THE NEXT BIG THING IN BITCOIN

Firstly, I would like to thank the team over at Bitnob for 
providing this opportunity for me to showcase what I think are 
the pondering issues in the African space and how Bitcoin can 
play a vital role in tackling those issues.Special thanks must also 
go to my very good friend Theodora (Theo as I would fondly call 
her) for introducing me to Bitnob and this hackathon.

If you refer to me as a jack of all trades; you are absolutely right.

THE PROBLEM;
My MVP aims to tackle two major issues which would be 
divided into economic and social problems.
Lets start with the Economic Problem;
Unemployment in Africa is currently at an all-time 
high.Countries like South Africa and Nigeria sit at the top of
Countries with the highest unemployment rates.This doesn’t 
tell well especially of the latter’s status as the ‘Giant of Africa’ 
This brings me to the first problem “Africa and the problem of 
unemployment”
Lets now dive into the Social Problem;
This is the 21st century and it’s really sad that we find 
ourselves living in a society where our basic and fundamental 
human rights are being trampled upon. Although one may 
argue that violations of human rights is a global problem; which 
is quite true but a lookup of stats from the United Nations 
proof that Africa compared to it’s European & American 
counterparts are leaning behind in terms of recognizing our 
basic human rights.
This brings me to the second problem “Africa and the 
challenges of providing a safe environment for BITCOIN 
investors” 
You may be wondering what the connection between Human 
rights and A safe environment for bitcoin investors is? The 
answer is Human left (I hope that joke put a smile on your face).
A more practical example that would enable us makes sense of 
the connection between the both is the twitter ban in Nigeria;
The ban on twitter in Nigeria opposes Article 19 of the 
Universal Declaration Of Human Rights which states that 
“Everyone has the rights to freedom of opinion and 
expression; this rights includes freedom to hold opinions 
without interference and to seek, receive and impact 
information and ideas through any media and regardless of 
frontiers.
As cited in an article on Pulse.ng 39 million Nigerians use twitter, 
18 million of those Nigerians use twitter for their businesses and 
a whooping 7.6 million of those Nigerians use twitter to 
communicate with fellow Bitcoin investors, use twitter for 
cryptocurrency education and enlightenment.As a result of the 
ban on twitter in Nigeria which has been deemed an abuse of human right, only echoes doom as Nigerians would be left 
behind in the fast paced global crypto world, loosing out on 
crypto related jobs, and credibility in the global crypto space. 
THE SOLUTION;
Honestly what seems to be the best solution is to miraculously 
sleep and wake up as president and enact some laws and 
policies that facilitate the decrease in the aforementioned 
problems, but while waiting for me to become president or for 
the federal government to uplift the ban on twitter we can 
alternatively make use of the the BitHub App that seeks to 
breach the gap between Bitcoin investors and other Bitcoin 
investors; the idea of this app is to enable Bitnobbers(an
unofficial name I call Bitnob users) 

⚫ Communicate with each other through private chat.

⚫ Post on the timeline which can be read by other users.

⚫ Provide a platform for freelance Bitnobbers to showcase 
their services to other users and get paid in Bitcoin
(Reducing unemployment in Africa).

⚫ Send and request Bitcoin easily from other users powered 
by the Bitnob API.
In respect to the the Hackathon instructions which states we 
should build a minimum viable products (MVP) ,the first release 
of this app wouldn't be cross platform and i intend on creating 
an android version first.
Lastly I would like to re-echo my gratitude to Bitnob for 
providing me this platform, as it presented me the opportunity to learn an entirely new programming language (Java) and also

perfect my skills in backend development.
